# Translation

By default the language used by boilerplate is the application language declared into `config/app.php` (locale). You can
define another language only for the back-office by setting `locale` parameter in `config/boilerplate/app.php`.  

Supported language are English, French, Italian, Persian, Spanish and Turkish.

When you run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=boilerplate`, only the language files for form validation are copied 
for supported languages. Thanks to [Laravel-Lang/lang](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang) package !

You can translate or change translations by running `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=boilerplate-lang`. After running 
this command, you will find translations folders into `resources/lang/vendor/boilerplate`. Copy one of the language 
folders in the new language you want to create and all you have to do is to translate. If you want to share the 
language you have added, don't hesitate to make a pull request.
