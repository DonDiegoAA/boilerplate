# Localization

By default the language used by boilerplate is the application language declared into `config/app.php` (locale). You can
define another language only for the back-office by setting `locale` parameter in `config/boilerplate/app.php`.  
Supported language are English, French, Spanish and Turkish.

When you run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sebastienheyd\Boilerplate\BoilerplateServiceProvider"`, only the
language files for form validation are copied for supported languages. Thanks to
[Laravel-Lang/lang](https://github.com/Laravel-Lang/lang) package !

You can translate into a language not yet supported by copying the
[`src/resources/lang/boilerplate`](src/resources/lang/boilerplate) folder content into
`resources/lang/vendor/boilerplate` folder. After that, copy or rename one of the language folders in the new language
folder to create. All you have to do is translate. If you want to share the language you have added, don't hesitate to
make a pull request.
